## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
HearthShare is a free, locally-hosted code sharing environment meant to allow people to effectively write code together from different locations.

[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-irish/) began  this project because I couldn't find a free online shared text editor that I liked while doing technical interview practice with some friends.



## üëâ Alternatives <a name ="alternatives"></a>

- [firebase](https://firebase.io) - Has a demo version and some examples that can be used in a similar way.
